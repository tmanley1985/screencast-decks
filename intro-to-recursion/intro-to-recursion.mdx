# Intro To Recursion

---

### What I will assume about you

<div style={{ maxWidth: "80%", fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <ul>
    <li style={{marginBottom: '15px'}}>You have a basic understanding of javascript syntax, especially es6</li>
    <li style={{marginBottom: '15px'}}>You want to learn</li>
    <li style={{marginBottom: '15px'}}>...and that's it</li>
  </ul>
</div>

---

### Definitions are tricky

<div style={{ maxWidth: "80%"}}>Words can have multiple definitions depending on the context.
I'm going to try to keep the definitions simple.</div>

---

#### Recursion is a function that calls itself... ðŸ¤”

<div style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>There's a bit more to it than that because there's also Corecursion, Indirect and Direct Recursion, Trampolining, etc.</div>

---

### Why?

---

<div style={{ maxWidth: "80%"}}>
  For problems that can be broken into sub problems that look the same, recursion can be a more elegant solution (it involves less steps)
</div>

<Step>

```js subtitle="Recursive"
const DFS = root => {
  if (!root) {
    return
  }

  console.log(root)
  root.left && DFS(root.left)
  root.right && DFS(root.right)
}
```

```js subtitle="Iterative"
const DFS = root => {

    if (!root)
        return

    let stack = [root]

    while (stack.length) {

        const node = stack.shift()
        console.log(node)
        const children = [node.right, node.left]
            
        for (const child of children) {
            if (child && !child.visited) {
                child.visited = true
                stack.unshift(child)
            }
        }

    }

}

### Pop Quiz

Try to implement a join function on strings recursively.

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="So something like this"

join(["Hello", " ", "world!"]) // "Hello world!"
