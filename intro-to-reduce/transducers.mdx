## Prerequisites

---

## Keep The Context Low

We'll look at a naive example first so that we can understand the concept.
Then we'll look at a real world use case that will solidify our understanding.

---

## A Motivating Example

---

## First Pass

run the predicate function and map in the body of Reducers

<CodeSurfer>

```js

import { isEven, }

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Transducers To The Rescue

---

## Higher Order Functions

---

## Reducers Returning Reducers

---

## Reducers Factory (Making NEW Reducers)

---

## Mapper, Filterer (makeFilterReducer, makeMapReducer)

---

## Real World Use case

---

## And That's It!
