## Transducers Part 1: Mapping

---

## Prerequisites

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>You have an understanding of javascript, especially es6</li>
  <li>You've been following along or understand reduce already</li>
  <li>You understand currying and partial application</li>
  <li>You understand function composition</li>
  <li>And that's it!</li>
</div>

---

## Keep The Context Low

Naive examples are easier to understand

---

## A Motivating Example

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js

import { isEven, addOne } from 'some-math-file'

[1,2,3,4]
  .map(addOne)
  .filter(isEven) // [2,4]

```

```js

import { isEven, addOne } from 'some-math-file'

[1,2,3,4]
  .reduce((acc, val) => {
    // Add one to the current value.
    const transformedValue = addOne(val)
  
    // Keep only even numbers.
    if (!isEven(transformedValue))
      return acc

    // Push the transformed item onto the accumulator
    acc.push(transformedValue)

    return acc

  }, []) // [2,4]

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Transducers To The Rescue

---

## Benefits

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>Only one iteration</li>
  <li>Only one intermediate data structure</li>
  <li>Should work on different data structures (streams, trees, etc)</li>
  <li>Because of how reducers compose, we can preserve readability</li>
</div>

---

## Higher Order Functions

---

##### Transducers take a <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing function</strong> and return a new <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing function</strong>

---

### Remember the signature of a <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing function</strong>

---

#### (accumulator, currentValue) => <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>newAccumulator</strong>

---

##### What if we wanted to allow any transformation like <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>Array.map</strong>?

```js title="How could we change the transducer to do that?"

// This is a reducing function too!

### Transducers Compose!

---

### The <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>output</strong> of a transducer is a reducing function

---

### The <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>input</strong> of a transducer is a reducing function

---


const transducer = reducingFn => (acc,val) => reducingFn(acc, val)

const newTransducer = transducer(transducer(concat))

---

<CodeSurfer>


```js title="Let's step through the code"

const composeTransducers = (transducerOne, transducerTwo) => reducingFn => transducerOne(transducerTwo(reducingFn))

// This is a reducing function too!
const concat = (acc, val) => acc.concat(val)

// This creates a transducer!
const makeTransducer = transformFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, transformFn(val))

// These return transducers!
const addOneTransducer = makeTransducer(val => val + 1)
const timesTwoTransducer = makeTransducer(val => val * 2)

const addOneAndDoubleTransducer = compose(addOneTransducer, timesTwoTransducer)

const concatReducingFn = addOneAndDoubleTransducer(concat) // returns a reducing function!

[1,2,3,4].reduce(concatReducingFn, []) // [4,6,8,10]

```

```diff title="We have our compose function"

```diff title="And we'll create a new function"
```

```diff title="That is the composition of our two transducers"
```

```diff title="Important: These will execute from left to right"
```

```diff title="This is because transducers will transform the data first, then call the function that's passed in"
```

#### So we've handled <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>transformations</strong>

---

#### What about <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>filtering</strong>?

---

#### We'll talk about that in part two

---

#### This is already a lot to digest

---

#### Homework

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Create a transducer that will transform lowercase letters to uppercase"

['a', 'b', 'c'].reduce(upperCaseReducer, []) // ['A', 'B', 'C']

```
