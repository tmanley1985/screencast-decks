1. Name your accumulator and current value appropriately
    - Gives context
2. Keep the scope of the function low
    - Single responsibility, if the function is getting too big, consider
    splitting it up
3. Remember the extra params
    - You have access to the current index and the array you're operating on
4. Don't reinvent map, filter, etc.
    - It's good for a learning exercise
    - If all you're doing is transforming values, use map.
    - If all you're doing is 
5. Create wrapper functions
    - This helps improve readability and gives context
6. Define your reducers separately
    - If it makes sense to do so, write your reducer separately
    - This gives a name to the operation and can give context
7. Not using reduceRight
    - This is javascript specific but instead of reversing an array and then operating on it
    - Just use reduceRight
8. Use early returns for improved readability
    - Returning the accumulator early reduces code bloat
9. Optimize Using Reduce
    - If the data you're using is sufficiently large, multiple dot chain calls are inefficient
    - You may even opt for a loop instead
10. Always Use An accumulator
    - In javascript you don't have to, but it's better to be explicit
    - Prevents having to do a check in the reducer to see if the accumulator is set

reduce()
