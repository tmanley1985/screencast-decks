### Let's Build Reduce Using Recursion

---

### Prerequisites


<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>You have an understanding of javascript, especially es6</li>
  <li>You've been following along in the Intro To Reduce series</li>
  <li>You've watched my Intro To Recursion video</li>
  <li>And that's it!</li>
</div>

---

### Let's Review: Reduce Has Three Parts

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>An iterable (we'll only be using arrays here)</li>
  <li>An initial value known as the accumulator, often the empty state</li>
  <li>A reducing function that will return a new accumulator</li>
</div>

## We'll write this in 2 ways

---

## 1. Passing The Tail

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Head and Tail"

const arr = [1,2,3,4]
const [head, ...tail] = arr

head // 1
tail = [2,3,4]

```

```js title="An Empty Tail"

const arr = [1]
const [head, ...tail] = arr

head // 1
tail = []

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Wall Of Code Alert"

const reduce = (reducingFn, accumulator, arr) => {
	if (arr.length === 0)
        return accumulator

    const newAccumulator = reducingFn(accumulator, arr[0])

	return reduce(reducingFn, newAccumulator, arr.slice(1))
}

reduce((acc,val) => acc + val, 0, [1,2,3])

```

```diff 2[16:45] title="Look familiar?"
```

```diff 3,4 title="Base Case: If the array is empty, there's nothing left to do!"
```

```diff 6 title="Call the reducing function to get the new accumulator"
```

```diff 6[39:50] title="We'll pass in the current accumulator"
```

```diff 6[52:57] title="And the head of the array"
```

```diff 8 title="Finally, we need to recurse so we can move through the array"
```

```diff 8 title="And move toward our base case"
```

```diff 8 title="So reduce will call itself"
```

```diff 8[19:28] title="The reducing function stays the same"
```

```diff 6[11:24],8[31:44] title="We'll pass in the new accumulator"
```

```diff 8[47:58] title="And here's where we can move toward our base case"
```

```diff 8[47:58] title="We're going to pass in the tail of the array"
```

```diff 8[47:58] title="This will ensure the array gets smaller and smaller"
```

```diff 3,8[47:58] title="Eventually becoming empty and hitting our base case!"
```

```diff title="Could we clean some of this up?"
```

```js title="We can remove the intermediate variable"

const reduce = (reducingFn, accumulator, arr) => {
	if (arr.length === 0)
        return accumulator

	return reduce(reducingFn, reducingFn(accumulator, arr[0]), arr.slice(1))
}

reduce((acc,val) => acc + val, 0, [1,2,3])

```

```js title="If you're into the whole brevity thing"

const reduce = (reducingFn, accumulator, arr) =>
    arr.length === 0
        ? accumulator
        : reduce(reducingFn, reducingFn(accumulator, arr[0]), arr.slice(1))

reduce((acc,val) => acc + val, 0, [1,2,3])


```

</CodeSurfer>

## 2. Using An Incrementer

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Just like a for loop!"

const arr = [1,2,3]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}

// 1
// 2
// 3

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js

const reduce = (reducingFn, accumulator, arr, i = 0) => {

	if (i > arr.length - 1)
        return accumulator
        
    // Now that we have the index (i) we can pass that in as well!
    const newAccumulator = reducingFn(accumulator, arr[i], i, arr)

	return reduce(reducingFn, newAccumulator, arr, i + 1)
}


reduce((acc,val) => acc + val, 0, [1,2,3])

```

```diff 2[47:51] title="We're keeping track of the current index in the array"
```

```diff 4,5 title="We'll stop the recursion once i moves out of bounds"
```

```diff 8 title="We're still going to generate our new accumulator"
```

```diff 8[60:65] title="We'll pass the current index in, along with the array"
```

```diff 10 title="We're still going to recurse"
```

```diff 10[47:51] title="We'll pass in the entire array"
```

```diff 10[50:56] title="And we're incrementing i to move through the array"
```

```diff 4,5 title="Eventually, i will move out of bounds, stopping the recursion"
```

</CodeSurfer>
