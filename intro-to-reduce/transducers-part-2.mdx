## Transducers Part 2: Filtering

---

## Prerequisites

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>You have an understanding of javascript, especially es6</li>
  <li>You've been following along or understand reduce already</li>
  <li>You've watched the first video on transducers</li>
  <li>And that's it!</li>
</div>

## A Review Of What We've Learned

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>Transducers are <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>functions</strong></li>
  <li>Transducers take <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing functions </strong>and return NEW <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing functions</strong></li>
  <li>Transducers <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>modify the input</strong> (usually the current value) to the <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>reducing function</strong></li>
  <li>Transducers reduce <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>unnecessary iteration</strong></li>
  <li>Transducers only need <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>one intermediate array</strong></li>
  <li>Transducers <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>compose</strong> with one another (<strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>executing left to right</strong>)</li>

#### Transducers In The Context Of Arrays

## A Motivating Example

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="How could we use transducers to accomplish this?"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

[1,2,3,4]
  .filter(isEven) // [2,4]

```
</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Remember this?"

const theSimplestTransducer = reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, val)

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Not very interesting"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const theSimplestTransducer = reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, val)

const concat = (acc, val) => {
    acc.push(val)
    return acc
}

const reducingFn = theSimplestTransducer(concat)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(reducing, []) // [1,2,3,4]

```

```js title="How could we change our transducer to remove even numbers?"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const theSimplestTransducer = reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, val)

const concat = (acc, val) => {
    acc.push(val)
    return acc
}

const reducingFn = theSimplestTransducer(concat)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(reducingFn, []) // [1,2,3,4]

```


```js title="Let's rename our transducer"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const keepEvenNumsTransducer = reducingFn => (acc, val) => isEven(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

const concat = (acc, val) => {
    acc.push(val)
    return acc
}

const reducingFn = keepEvenNumsTransducer(concat)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(reducingFn, []) // [2,4]

```

```diff 4[32:42] title="It will take a reducing function"
```

```diff 4[46:99] title="And produce a NEW reducing function"
```

```diff 4[60:70] title="That will check to see if the current value is even"
```

```diff 4[74:93] title="If it is, we'll just pass the accumulator and current value to the reducing function"
```

```diff 4[97:99] title="But if it isn't even, we'll just return the accumulator"
```

```diff 4[97:99] title="Effectively removing the value"
```

```diff 13 title="We only keep even numbers"
```

#### But what if we wanted to use <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>any</strong> predicate function?

---

#### Like <strong style={{color: "#FEBE9C"}}>Array.filter</strong>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="How could we modify this transducer to accomplish that?"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const keepEvenNumsTransducer = reducingFn => (acc, val) => isEven(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

```

```js title="What if we accept a predicate function?"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const keepEvenNumsTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

```

```js title="But now the name doesn't make sense"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const keepEvenNumsTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

```

```js title="How about this?"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'

const makeFilterTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

```

```diff title="It's a factory for transducers that will filter elements"
```

```diff 4[30:40] title="It will take a function like isEven, isOdd, etc."
```

```diff 4[45:117] title="That will produce a NEW transducer"
```

```diff 4[45:54] title="And like all transducers, it will accept a reducing function"
```

```diff 4[59:117] title="And like all transducers, when called, it will create a NEW reducing function"
```

```diff 4[73:88] title="But we'll use our predicate function first"
```

```diff 4[92:111] title="If the result is true, we'll call the reducing function"
```

```diff 4[115:117] title="If not, we'll just return the accumulator"
```

```diff 4[115:117] title="Effectively skipping the element"
```

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Let's put it to use"

import { isEven } from 'some-math-file'
import { concat } from 'some-utils-file'

const makeFilterTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc

const isEvenTransducer = makeFilterTransducer(isEven)

const reducingFn = isEvenTransducer(concat)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(reducingFn, []) // [2,4]

```

```diff 2,3 title="We're going to import our isEven and concat functions"
```

```diff 5 title="We have our function to make filter transducers"
```

```diff 7 title="We create a transducer to filter even numbers by partially applying isEven"

const isEvenTransducer = makeFilterTransducer(isEven)

const filterEvensReducingFn = isEvenTransducer(concat)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(filterEvensReducingFn, []) // [2,4]

```

```diff 11 title="And we can use it below!"
```

</CodeSurfer>

### So we've handled filter operations

---

#### But I promised something

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="How can we accomplish this with transducers?"

import { isEven, addOne } from 'some-math-file'

[1,2,3,4]
  .map(addOne)
  .filter(isEven) // [2,4]

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

#### Composition!

---

<CodeSurfer>


```js title="Wut."

import { isEven, addOne } from 'some-math-file'
import { concat } from 'some-utils-file'

const makeFilterTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc
const makeMapTransducer    = transformFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, transformFn(val))

const isEvenTransducer = makeFilterTransducer(isEven)
const addOneTransducer = makeMapTransducer(addOne)

const addOneFilterEvenReducingFn = addOneTransducer(isEvenTransducer(concat))

[1,2,3,4].reduce(addOneFilterEvenReducingFn, []) // [2,4]

```

```diff 5,6 title="We have a way to create two different types of transducers"
```

```diff 8,9 title="We can use them here"
```

```diff 11 title="And because of composition, we can map first, then filter"
```

```diff 11 title="Remember that transducers will execute left to right under composition"
```

```diff 13 title="And we can use our reducing function below!"
```

```js title="You could optionally use a compose function"

import { isEven, addOne } from 'some-math-file'
import { concat, compose } from 'some-utils-file'

const makeFilterTransducer = predicateFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => predicateFn(val) ? reducingFn(acc, val) : acc
const makeMapTransducer    = transformFn => reducingFn => (acc, val) => reducingFn(acc, transformFn(val))

const isEvenTransducer = makeFilterTransducer(isEven)
const addOneTransducer = makeMapTransducer(addOne)

const addOneFilterEvenTransducer = compose(addOneTransducer, isEvenTransducer)

[1,2,3,4].reduce(addOneFilterEvenTransducer(concat), []) // [2,4]

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

#### Real World Use Case

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Kind of."

import { isPaid, pluckOrderNumber } from 'some-helpers-file'
import { concat, compose } from 'some-utils-file'
import { makeFilterTransducer, makeMapTransducer } from 'some-transducers-file'
import { getOrders } from 'some-external-api'

const isPaidTransducer = makeFilterTransducer(isPaid)
const pluckOrderNumberTransducer = makeMapTransducer(pluckOrderNumber)

const getPaidOrderNumbersTransducer = compose(isPaidTransducer, pluckOrderNumberTransducer)

const orders = await getOrders() // [{ isPaid: true, orderNumber: 1234 }, { isPaid: false, orderNumber: 4567 }]

const paidOrderNumbers = orders.reduce(getPaidOrderNumbersTransducer(concat), []) // [1234]

```

```diff 2,3,4,5 title="Some imports"
```

```diff 7,8 title="We'll create our filter and map transducers"
```

```diff 10 title="We'll compose those together"
```

```diff 12 title="We'll grab our orders. Note the structure."
```

```diff 14 title="And we'll use reduce to get the paid order numbers"
```

</CodeSurfer>
