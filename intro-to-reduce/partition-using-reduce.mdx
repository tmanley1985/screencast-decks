# Partition Using Reduce

---

### Prerequisites


<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>You have an understanding of javascript, especially es6</li>
  <li>You've been following along or understand reduce already</li>
  <li>And that's it!</li>
</div>

### What is a partition function?

<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  It's a function that will separate elements of an array based on a condition, into two buckets:
  the elements that passed the condition, and those that did not.
</div>

```js title="A simple example"

import { partition, isEven } from './some-utils-file'

const numbers = [1,2,3,4]

partition(isEven, numbers) // [ [2,4], [1,3] ]

```

```diff 2 title="Let's import some functions"
```

```diff 4 title="We have an array"
```

```diff 6[1:26] title="Call our partition function"
```

```diff 6[11:16] title="We pass in a predicate function"
```

```diff 6[19:25] title="And an array to partition"

```

```diff 6[33:37] title="The elements that passed the predicate"
```

```diff 6[40:44] title="The elements that failed the predicate"
```


```js title="You can leverage destructuring to aid in readability"

import { partition, isEven } from './some-utils-file'

const numbers = [1,2,3,4]

const [passed, failed] = partition(isEven, numbers)

```

<CodeSurfer>


```js title="A simple way to write this"

const partition = (predicateFn, arr) => [
  arr.filter(predicateFn),
  arr.filter(element => predicateFn(element) === false)
]

```

```diff 2[20:30] title="We'll take a predicateFn"
```

```diff 2[33:35] title="And an array to partition"
```

```diff 2[41:41],5[1:1] title="And return a new array"
```

```diff 3 title="The first element is an array of elements that passed the predicate"
```

```diff 4 title="The second element is an array of elements that failed the predicate"
```


```js 4 title="You can shorten this by using the NOT operator"

const partition = (predicateFn, arr) => [
  arr.filter(predicateFn),
  arr.filter(element => !predicateFn(element))
]

```

```diff 4 title="I like to read this as follows"
```

```diff 4[14:20] title="Keep the element"

```

```diff title="Problem: We iterate twice"
```

### Now let's use reduce!

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Wall of code warning"

const partition = (predicateFn, arr) =>
  arr.reduce(
    (acc, item) => {
      if (predicateFn(item)) {
        acc[0].push(item)
        return acc
      }

      acc[1].push(item)
      return acc
    },
    [ [], [] ]
  )

```

```diff 2[19:36] title="The parameter list is the same"
```

```diff 3,14 title="Let's call reduce"
```

```diff 13 title="Our accumulator is going to be an array with two inner arrays!"
```

```diff 13 title="This way, we can just push onto one of them"
```

```diff 4,12 title="Let's think about our reducing function"
```

```diff 5,8 title="First, we'll check to see if the item passes"
```

```diff 6,7 title="If it does, push onto the passed array and return the accumulator"
```

```diff 10,11 title="If it did not, push onto the failed array and return the accumulator"
```

```diff title="This will happen for each element, building up the two inner arrays"
```

</CodeSurfer>

### Why might we use this?

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Slightly real world use case"

import { partition } from './some-utils-file'

const customers = [
  {isPaid: true, name: 'Bob'},
  {isPaid: false, name: 'Linda'}
]

const [paid, unpaid] = partition(customer => customer.isPaid, customers)
```

```js title="Slightly real world use case part deux"

import { partition } from './some-utils-file'

const blogPosts = [
  {isDraft: true, slug: 'great-post'},
  {isDraft: false, slug: 'another-post'}
]

const [unPublished, published] = partition(post => post.isDraft, blogPosts)
```

</CodeSurfer>

### And that's it!
