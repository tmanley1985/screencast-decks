# Pure Functions

---

## Given the same input, you get the same output

---

## No Side Effects

---

## What Are Side Effects?

---

## Side effects are anything that could conceivably cause the output to be different

---

## A bit nebulous I know...

---

## Here are certain examples


<div style={{ width: '80%', fontSize: '.75em'}}>
  <li>Interacting with a variable outside of the function's scope</li>
  <li>Logging</li>
  <li>Randomness</li>
</div>

---

## The problem is the world (state) can shift underneath your feet.

---

## Everything needs to be input to the function

<Step>

```js title="Notice the output changes even don't change the input"

let a = 3

const addOne = () => a + 1

addOne() // 4

a = 4

addOne() // 5

```

```js title="Same output for same input"

const addOne = x => x + 1

addOne(3) // 4

```
